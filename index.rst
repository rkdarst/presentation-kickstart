Aalto Scientific Computing's kickstart course
===============================================

About
-----
* Me

  * Computational researcher for 15 years
  * Five years ago, HPC team
  * Now, usability and teaching of computing

* Aalto Scientific Computing

  * Small team, nine people
  * We can't really operate on an industrial scale, instead we operate
    based on passion and complementing the big people.
  * Part of "Finnish Grid Infrastructure" (current name: Finnish Computing
    Competence Infrastructure).
  * We are *not* part of CSC.



The big picture
---------------
* Crisis of Computing

  * Term I have coined
  * Computing needed by almost everyone
  * Many researchers arrive unprepared to do their work
  * **Easy solution: "if you aren't ready it's not our issue, don't
    support them".  Often used by big centers**
  * **We focus on helping everyone to do their work**

* Scientific Computing in Practice

  * https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/
  * Practical courses, everything from shell basics to MPI.

* Hand-on scientific computing

  * https://handsonscicomp.readthedocs.io/
  * Online course to fill in all gaps that anyone may have.
  * Incorporates Carpentries, CodeRefinery, Kickstart, and more.
  * Not a course but a map (since everything already exists
    somewhere).

* Aalto Research Software Engineers

  * When people need to do something but don't have time or skills to
    do it themselves.



About the kickstart course
--------------------------

https://scicomp.aalto.fi/training/scip/summer-kickstart/

* Since 2016 or so
* Continually refined over time
* Starting point for new users of our HPC cluster

  * Not focused on "high-performance" but "computing"

* Contents (typical)

  * Day 1, general background, lectures.  Rotating topics:

    * HPC crash course
    * Shell crash course
    * Overview to computing workflows
    * Git intro
    * CSC computing resources

  * Day 2-3, hands-on with the cluster

    * Focused around our cluster tutorials:

Sharing the kickstart course
----------------------------

* Remote work = *closer to everyone else*

* Why not open our course to others, even if we use our cluster as an
  example.

  * **Con:** examples don't necessarily work out of the box.
  * **Pro:** something that other sites simply didn't have.
  * **Pro:** many important messages outside of examples.
  * *We took the opportunity to standardize our Finnish clusters a
    little bit.*

* Timeline

  * June 2020: Online, joint with others in Finland.  Other countries
    invited (via CodeRefinery).
  * February 2021: developed with general day 1, day 2 open.
  * June 2021: MOOC, fully streamed, distributed.



Current teaching strategy
-------------------------
* A lot like CodeRefinery
* We try to be interactive and have examples.
* Realize there are different levels of people

  * Some want to watch passively, they need to learn conventions of
    the community before they dive in
  * Some want to do examples
  * Some are quite advanced



Tech setup
----------
* CodeRefinery MOOC:
  https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/coderefinery-mooc/

  .. image:: https://coderefinery.github.io/manuals/_images/mooc-diagram.png

  * There is *not* one Zoom meeting, instead "TV studio" and
    "audience"
  * TV studio has instructors and production crew
  * Broadcast to entire world via Twitch
  * Separate Zoom with students (who want to) and helpers
  * All student feedback comes through HackMD (with hundreds of people
    no student talks anyway).



Benefits
--------

Advantages:

* HackMD is a much better tool for answering questions.
* No privacy concerns behind recordings, recording comes same day.
* We can allow anyone to watch while not giving out Zoom link
  publicly.


Problems
--------

Disadvantages:

* Course: always a bit of problems with incompatible sites.
* Tech: Takes some getting used to, I still have to train others to do it.


Future prospects
----------------
- Generic platform or localized?
- Generic days and local days?
