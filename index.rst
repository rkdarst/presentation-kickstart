Aalto Scientific Computing's kickstart course
===============================================

About
-----
* Me
* Aalto Scientific Computing

  * Small team, nine people
  * We can't really operate on an industrial scale, instead we operate
    based on passion.

About the kickstart course
--------------------------
* Since 2016 or so, continually refined
* Starting point for new users of our HPC cluster

  * Not focused on "high-performance" but "computing"


The big picture
---------------
* Crisis of Computing

  * Computing needed by almost everyone
  * Many researchers arrive unprepared to do their work
  * Easy solution: "if you aren't ready it's not our issue, don't
    support them".  Often used by big centers
  * We focus on helping everyone to do their work

* Scientific Computing in Practice

  * Practical courses, everything from shell basics to MPI.

* Hand-on scientific computing

  * https://handsonscicomp.readthedocs.io/
  * Online course to fill in all gaps that anyone may have.
  * Incorporates Carpentries, CodeRefinery, Kickstart, and more.
  * Not a course but a map (since everything already exists
    somewhere).

* Aalto Research Software Engineers

  * When people need to do something but don't have time or skills to
    do it themselves.



Teaching strategy
-----------------
* A lot like CodeRefinery
* We try to be interactive and have examples.  But, 


Tech setup
----------
* CodeRefinery MOOC:

* "TV studio" and "audience"


Benefits
--------

Problems
--------


Future prospects
----------------
- Generic platform or localized?
- Generic days and local days?
